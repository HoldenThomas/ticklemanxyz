        Once upon a time there was a human person. He had to fight some bad guys
        because they didn't believe in the tickle. Thereafter, the ticklemaan
        was born. He went around shooting people with his tickle fingers,
        sending them into tickle comas. Thus converting them to the almighty
        tickle. The end!
