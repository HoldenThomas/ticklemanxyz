    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>The Tickle Man was a creature that no one had ever seen, but his presence was
felt everywhere. His victims always reported the same thing - a tickling sensation,
followed by an overwhelming sense of terror. No one knew where The Tickle Man
came from, or what he wanted. Some said he was a demon, summoned from the
depths of Hell to torment the living. Others claimed he was a scientist,
driven mad by his own experiments. Despite the many theories, one thing was
certain - The Tickle Man was not to be trifled with. He left a trail of victims
in his wake, all of them driven to the brink of insanity by his relentless tickling.
One night, as I lay in bed, I felt a tickling sensation on my foot.
I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a stray strand of bedspread,
but the tickling persisted. I sat up and looked around the room,
but there was no one there. The tickling moved up my leg, and I felt a sense
of panic wash over me. I tried to get out of bed and run, but my legs were too weak.
The Tickle Man had me in his grasp, and there was no escape. I closed my eyes and
waited for the end, praying for mercy from a creature that had none. And as
the tickling consumed me, I knew that I was the latest victim of The Tickle Man.</p>
