    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a human person. He had to fight some bad guys
because they didn&rsquo;t believe in the tickle. Thereafter, the ticklemaan was
born. He went around shooting people with his tickle fingers, sending them
into tickle comas. Thus converting them to the almighty tickle. The end!</p>
